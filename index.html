            <h2>On The Street In Brooklyn</h2>
            <p>Yeah, this album is dedicated To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin' To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
                Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
                And all the neighbors in the struggle You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby
                It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
                Hangin' pictures on my wall Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
                I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped Smokin' weed in Bambu, sippin' on Private Stock
                Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack With the hat to match
                Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
                Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
